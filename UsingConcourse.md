# Using Concourse

# What is it?

Concourse is really just a flow definition tool a bit like Spring XD excpet instead of a DSL it uses a YAML description file. Although the flow can be visualised, once specified, in the cool web GUI, you can't define it that way.

I personally found the documentation was not really clear until you knew what it was trying to explain, so here is a quick overview on how to use Concourse.

# Getting Started

To run Concourse you need:

1. To run it in a Virtual Machine using Vagrant and Virtual box. In any directory run:
 
   ```
   vagrant init concourse/lite # creates ./Vagrantfile
   vagrant up                  # downloads the box & spins up the VM
   ```

1. You can then access its web interface in any browser at [http://192.168.100.4:8080](http://192.168.100.4:8080)

1. Finally download the Fly CLI from the main page where there are links to binaries for common platforms.  Save it in a sensible place.

1. `fly` is an executable so on Mac or Linux run `chmod a+x` to make it executable.  The Windows version is `fly.exe`, so you can skip this step.

1. Add `fly` to your `PATH`.

The Concourse [Getting Started](http://concourse.ci/getting-started.html) guide now gets you to create a YAML flow definition and run it, which you can do now if you wish.   However I think it helps to understand what Concourse does first and _then_ run a flow.

# Concepts

A flow, which Concourse calls a Job, consists of Tasks and Resources.

## Tasks

A task is simply a specification of work to run.  Most tasks are Unix scripts and or executables.  A task is specified by a YAML file, such as `test-task.yml` like this:

```
---
platform: linux

image: docker:///ubuntu#14.04

inputs:
- name: concourse-intro

run:
  path: concourse-intro/scripts/test
```

Note that the task is actually executed by a Docker container, so I guess the Concourse VM has Docker installed internally.

This task runs the `test` script in `concourse-intro`.  Which brings us to resources.

## Resources

The `concourse-intro` input is a resource and it is specified as part of the job flow like this:

```
resources:
- name: concourse-intro
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/pivotal-anz/concourse-intro
    branch: master
``` 

To keep things simple for now, let's just assume this Github repository is public, like this one.

The script we want to run is in `concourse-intro/scripts`.

Thus to modify the task, modify `concourse-intro/scripts/test`, push the change and rerun the job.

Several types of predefined resources are provided by Concourse, including `git`.  If you look at the Concourse [github project](https://github.com/concourse?query=resource) you will see several resource sub-projects for both input (getting docker images, pulling from git, fetching data from Amazon S3) and output (pushing to Cloud Foundry, saving to S3).

## Jobs

We combine the resource and its task into a Job like this:

```
resources:
- name: concourse-intro
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/pivotal-anz/concourse-intro
    branch: master

jobs:
- name: test-pipeline
  - get: concourse-intro   # Fetch the resource
    trigger: true  # Rerun automatically if repo changes
  - task: unit     # Run the unit test
    file: concourse-intro/ci/test-task.yml
```

Note:

1. `concourse-intro` contains both the test script (`concourse-intro/scripts/test`) and the task (`concourse-intro/ci/test-task.yml`) to run it.
1. The task name `unit` is arbitrary.  There are _no_ predefined tasks.

A job consists of one or more "_steps_".  Just a few of the predefined job-steps are:

1. `get`: fetch a resource
1. `put`: update a resource
1. `task`: execute a task

Here is a complete example that fetches a resource (this project) from github and executes a script within it.

```
resources:
- name: concourse-intro
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/pivotal-anz/concourse-intro
    branch: master

jobs:
- name: test-pipeline
  plan:
  - get: concourse-intro
    trigger: true
  - task: unit
    file: concourse-intro/ci/test-task.yml
```

Let's call this `first.yml`.

# Running a Job

From a command line (Terminal or CMD window), run:

```
fly configure test-pipeline -c first.yml --paused=false
```

You will be prompted with `apply configuration? (y/n)` - just answer `y`.  This sets up the new Job as a pipeline and makes it runable (`paused=false`).

__Note:__ Make sure the name of the pipeline specified in `fly configure` is the same as the name in the YAML file.  They don't have to be the same, it's just annoyingly confusing if they aren't.

Once `fly` has setup the pipeline, it should also tell you the URL to use to view the pipeline [http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/test-pipeline](http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/test-pipeline).

Open this URL now and you should see:

![Pipeline Page](https://github.com/pivotal-anz/concourse-intro/blob/master/screenshots/pipeline-page.png)

Click on the grey-box and you see this:

![Pipeline Jobs Page](https://github.com/pivotal-anz/concourse-intro/blob/master/screenshots/pipeline-jobs-page.png)

Click the + button on the right to run the job (run the flow).

It will go orange (running) and then green (succeeded).  If it goes red, the job failed.

The run number (#1) will have appeared and so will the steps.  Click on concourse-intro and unit to make them show their output.  You should see this:

## Using the Web Interface

Takes a bit of getting used to.  The Home (house) icon takes you to the home page for the _current pipeline_.  Even going explicitly to [http://192.168.100.4:8080/](http://192.168.100.4:8080/) shows you the last pipeline used.

Once you have multiple pipelines you can see them by clicking on the tripple bar icon at the top _left_ (next to the house icon).  Select the pipeline you want.

The other triple bar icin (on the top _right_) shows you the builds that you have run.

# Online Documentation

This can be found here [http://concourse.ci](http://concourse.ci).  In case you are wondering, the Internet domain `ci` belongs to the Ivory Republic (Cote d'Ivoire in French).

I suggest looking at a complete pipeline first [http://concourse.ci/pipelines.html](http://concourse.ci/pipelines.html) to see a complete worked example.  Then work through the guide starting at [Getting Started](http://concourse.ci/getting-started.html).

Note that the Getting Started pipeline uses a special case of a task that embeds what it does instead of using an YAML file as described above, like this:

``` 
jobs:
- name: hello-world
  plan:
  - task: say-hello
    config:
      platform: linux
      image: "docker:///busybox"
      run:
        path: echo
        args: ["Hello, world!"]
```

The `say-hello` task is defined using the `config` sub-element instead of a YAML file.  Hence this flow requires no resources.

As a result, this flow appears in the Web GUI as a single grey box which doesn't look like a flow at all (since it has no input or output resources).

Whilst this is a nice simple first example, it is not typical and, personally, I found it more confusing than helpful.
